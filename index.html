Lily has a pretty athletic build which makes her look like she has a more boyish frame, though she’s filled out a lot more than when she was a lower ranking mage. Her skin is unblemished and has pink undertones which add a warmth to her fair skin. She has adopted sharper features over time but she’s kept her more rounded cheekbones and narrow--yet still clearly defined--jawline, as well as her pointed chin. Now that she’s aged as far as she has, her pointed toddler teeth have flattened out with a new set of normal, human teeth that don’t look nearly as menacing when she smiles. Lily has doe-like, magenta-colored eyes that have feline slits in the center rather than rounded human pupils, and the long curly hair that used to gradient from white to dark pink has become overcome by a bubblegum pink shade which falls down to the small of her back.

<div id="personality">
No longer is this particular Madragora locked in the same mindset as a toddler, as her magical progress has allowed her to develop both physically and mentally. Lily is fairly trusting of other individuals, but she’s more than aware of being able to put her own needs above the needs of others without feeling bad about it. The most pointed trait that remains is that she’s still pretty rough with people. Trying to figure out how to please everyone isn’t a feat she wishes to accomplish and she’d rather settle her differences with a fight rather than talk it out. Words can be manipulated and falsified, but strength is universal to her.

<h1>Paige Racials</h1>
<b>Immortality</b><br>
Madragora aren't conceived and born as the typical creature would be, and are the recycled souls of the dead given new bodies. These bodies are formed by a resurrection ritual including several materials and gemstones that determine body composition. The type of teeth determine what type of Madragora is created and their physical appearance, and the gemstones used determine intellectual and physical traits. Diamonds were used to construct her general form ( does not make her equal to diamonds in durability since she still retains base human durability ) which allows her to live until something other than old age claims her. The teeth used were Human teeth, giving her a similar outwards and internal framework.
<br><br>
<b>Magic Aging</b><br>
The Ritual used to construct Madragora requires a great deal of magic, and this magic is imbued into every fiber of their being. Their chemical makeup is completely altered to grow only when their mana pool does -- albeit at meager amounts considering even a full grown Madragora will not look like an adult human -- in such a way that they can go through a large amount of progress in little time and remain unharmed. However, skipping from Paige to maximum rank could have fatal difficulties since their body is actively responding to mana growth.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Speed</b><br>
Lily's gemstones were brilliant topaz, allowing her to run at double the speed of the average human being would be able to. This requires several seconds for her to reach her maximum speed since she is incapable of reaching it instantly.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Strength</b><br>
Another set of gems were used to form Lily's body: Ruby. The Rubies give her enhanced strength, allowing her to punch/kick twice as hard and lift things twice as heavy than the average human of her size could while also making her muscles take twice as long to heal if injured.
<br><br>
<b>Heightened Reflexes</b><br>
The fourth type of gems used in Lily's creation were Sapphire. Sapphire are attributed to mental facilities such as reflexes and intellect. In this case, Lily can process information and react to things twice as quickly than the average human would be able to.

<FONT COLOR="#CE3575">→</FONT> 3. Lily's Inventory
</div>
<div id="tab8">
<h1>Mundane Items</h1>
<b>Nisha's Gauntlet</b><br>
A memento from her past, this item is a pretty shining Rose Gold gauntlet that fits the childs hand poorly. The gauntlet itself is of standard design, except there are several glistening gemstones inlaid into the top of its structure that makes a perfect Lily Flower design over the back of the hand and the whole thing is Iron in strength except for areas designed for flexibility which are equal to Aluminum. Nisha's Gauntlet belonged to her deceased creator and was entrusted to her upon his death that resulted in her being thrust out of her birthrealm and into the Ulreich universe.
<br><br>
<b>Leather Satchel</b><br>
A small satchel constructed out of simple leather with a clip on the side to close it. This satchel is large enough to carry normal everyday things like a purse and currently is used to house her Slingshot ammunition.
<br><br>
<h1>Weapons</h1>
<b>Slingshot</b><br>
A small hand-held slingshot made of a thick twig. The slingshot is dense enough to take a moderate physical attack (less than Tin in strength meaning that it can be broken by base human strength) before breaking, and can shoot out small hand-held projectiles at the speed an average human could throw them overhand.
<br><br>
<b>Glitter Rocks</b><br>
Very simple items. These are rocks that Lily has super-glued together to be the size of an average softball, covered in glitter and pretty colored rhinestones. Getting hit by these wouldn’t be very nice at all considering that they are completely solid.
<br><br>
<h1>Unique Magic Items</h1>
  <b>Census Event Reward: The Mandragora Queen</b><br>
  A small, three foot tall little creature that takes the appearance of a typical mandragora from folklore, not necessarily related to Lily’s race. It has a pink flower on its head and slight pink accents over its white and brown frame. It has a titanium durability body, but will instantly desummon if any attack of this rank or higher comes into contact with it, making it unable to be resummoned for a duration of three rotations. It possesses x2 speed and reaction time at base, and can whip its tentacle-like arms at enemies in close range to slash them for titanium durability damage. While active, it must exist within a fifty foot range of the caster, and will desummon and require a cooldown if this length is surpassed.
  <br><b>Passive Ability</b><br>
  Whenever this summon is active, it will scan the area of its effective range with a slew of microscopic plant fibers that cover the entire fifty foot radius. These fibers are not harmful, but act as a conduit for sensory magic; any spells not hidden by countersensory of mage rank or higher will be instantly detected, and this information will telekinetically pass between the Mandragora Queen and its contract holder. Lily will be able to know the general area the magic occurred in relation to her (so a direction, not a specific location or distance away) as well as its type and rank (up to high mage: spells of high mage or above will be sensed as the same thing, so she won’t be able to tell which of the three ranks it actually is). If the tree is an archmage combo, she will only be able to tell the primary tree it uses.
  <br><b>Active Ability: Summon Onion Simp</b>
<br>The Mandragora Queen is a paganist who has the ability to summon her loyal subjects forth in order to do her bidding, and in this case she wants them to...Hide in the ground! Upon activation of the spell, the Mandragora Queen creates two Mandragora Simps...Er...Regular Mandragoras. These little critters (three feet tall, just like the queen) have bodies of titanium durability, but no special racials or powers other than the ability to dig into any surface of titanium toughness or below. They will spawn directly in front of the Queen and can move to any area within the fifty foot radius of her, but be mindful that it will take them quite a while to reach the full distance of their effective range. Upon digging into the earth, their little onion heads remain exposed and grow to create a dome of solid matter equaling up to six feet high and ten feet wide. These domes are titanium toughness and will remain (even if damaged, but not entirely destroyed) for up to five post rotations before withering away and dying. While these domes can be used as barriers, if the caster or the Mandragora Queen herself jump atop them they will act as bounce pads, sending them flying up to forty feet into the air and increasing their movement speed by x3 (upper limit of x6) ONLY during this jump. The caster is immune to fall damage during the descent as long as they do not drop a distance greater than fifty feet. If the Mandragora AND the caster maintain physical contact and channel both of their energies (without casting anything else) for a full rotation, then four of these simps will be summoned on the next post.

<h1>High Mage Medium</h1>
  <b>Galadriel</b>
<br>An ornate circular mirror decorated by beautiful silver and gold metal lattice work around its edges which is made of Titanium rather than the traditional--more fragile--materials normally used for such objects. It has a two foot diameter from edge-to-edge, and the mirror’s surface shimmers with a deep blue hue like swirling water though it remains transparent enough to see what is reflected upon it clearly. 
  <br><i>Major Enchantment Aspect</i>
<br>The true power of this medium lies in its ability to produce a “copy” of an object that is within the mirror’s reflection in the form of a mana construct equal to Titanium in strength. They cannot be created independently of a reflection, so if there’s nothing in the mirror to reflect she cannot generate a copy even if she’s already made a copy of something before and knows what it is/does. Copies cannot be larger than 10 feet in any direction, and cannot be affected by magic higher than High Mage in power. The mirror cannot create copy-constructs of complex items with multiple parts. High Auror Mediums, for example, are not something it’s able to mimic. If the object is mundane, the cost is relatively small, but in order to replicate a magical effect she has to have witnessed the effect she wishes to recreate prior to making the copy, so that it’s in her mind as she creates it otherwise she’ll just create a copy with no magic effects. Only ONE magical effect can be recreated on a copy even if the object she’s referencing has 10 separate effects. Special mana types such as Soul Force/Soulfire cannot be emulated this way (or magic that requires a special mana type to function). The amount of mana it takes to make a copy of magical objects depends on the rank difference, taking the most mana to create equal-rank objects. All copies produce a magic aura/aesthetic that makes it obvious what object is a fake and which one is not. Only two magical objects can be copied at a time, which can be broken in which case she will need to recreate them. They can exist within a 40 foot radius of her, and they don’t have a set timer before disappearing.
  <br><i>Minor Enchantment Aspect</i>
<br>Galadriel can be controlled telekinetically within 10 feet of Lily, and she can turn it to face any direction she chooses so long as she can see it. The speed at which it can be moved is limited to as fast as her current mental processing speed modifier, with a cap of x4, and it becomes inert if it leaves the previously described 10 foot range. If she re-enters the range, she can re-assert control over it without any issues whatsoever. As it is her medium, any of her Enchantment spells can be cast through it though it doesn’t increase any of the spells’ ranges. If an enchant has a beam with a range of 30 feet and the mirror is 10 feet away and firing in the opposite direction, then it would only go 20 feet before reaching its maximum distance from her.

<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
  <b>Big Boom!</b>
<br>The caster enchants an item no bigger than an average sword to become coated in a thick six-inch layer of easily broken cushion-like mana around one intended part after charging for one rotation. The object will remain otherwise unaffected but upon a large amount of force being applied to the cushion, it will burst and release the mana it held in an outwards blast of kinetic energy. This blast extends forwards in a three foot wide wave that is one foot from top to bottom that travels a maximum distance of ten feet and is capable of rending/warping physical constructs of Tin (scaling to Iron at mage) durability. The wave of kinetic energy causes very clear visible distortion in its path of travel, and is slow moving (about the speed of a fast-walk). Big Boom lasts for two posts and is single-use only, meaning that as soon as the mana bubble is broken the enchantment ends and immediately goes on a one rotation cool down timer but also that the cushion will explode on the final post regardless of circumstances even if no external force is applied. Can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle.
<br><br><b>Sock 'Em</b><br>
This enchantment enhances the object's impact force (provided the object is no larger than a baseball in size) for two full rotations before going on a one post cool down. While not actively increasing the actual weight of the item in question, the enchantment causes the item to begin charging up when moving through the air. The furthest possible distance an object can travel (in order for this enchantment to remain active and effective, not that the object itself will suddenly stop moving since it’s nonmagic) is ten feet. If the maximum of ten feet is achieved the objects impacting force is strong enough to feel like it’s slugging with added weight of up to ten pounds. Ten pounds is if the object travels as a projectile for a full ten feet, every foot it travels stacks a singular extra pound and this does not provide a piercing power, it has no destructive measurement, it simply increases the impacting force behind the base object. Can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle.
<br><br><b>No Thanks~</b><br>
When used on an small handheld object, this enchantment will become covered in a thick layer of the caster’s own nonsolid mana for three maximum posts. Without help of extra mana, the object will do seemingly nothing at all, but if the Enchanter weaves half of the amount of mana it took to cast the enchantment in the first place, the mana coating will suddenly be able to be manipulated into a one-time use only rounded pane of solid mana equal to Tin (scaling to Iron at Mage) in strength so long as it is directly in contact with the item and can be formed anywhere along its structure. This barrier is two feet in diameter and is capable of defending against a singular attack of equal ranking before breaking, primarily physical attacks. After the secondary effect is used, the barrier may remain for one post (unless destroyed) before both the barrier and the enchantment itself completely deactivate regardless if it hasn't hit the three-post limit. Can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle.
<br><h1>Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Upgrade to Big Boom!</b><br>
The caster enchants an item no bigger than an average sword to become coated in a thick six-inch layer of easily broken cushion-like mana around one intended part after charging for one rotation. The object will remain otherwise unaffected but upon a large amount of force being applied to the cushion, it will burst and release the mana it held in an outwards blast of kinetic energy. This blast extends forwards in a 5 foot wide wave that is 2 feet from top to bottom that travels a maximum distance of fifteen feet and is capable of rending/warping physical constructs of Iron (scaling to Cobalt at Expert Mage) durability. The wave of kinetic energy causes very clear visible distortion in its path of travel, and is moves at a medium pace (about the speed of a human jog). If an object less than average human weight or less (150~200 lbs)  is hit by this wave, they will be pushed backwards along with it to the maximum distance if not somehow removed from its path so long as they aren’t otherwise being held down or secured in place with spells and/or restraints greater than this spell’s capacity for damage. Anything less and the wave would break through and continue pushing. Big Boom lasts for two posts and is single-use only, meaning that as soon as the mana bubble is broken the enchantment ends and immediately goes on a one rotation cool down timer but also that the cushion will explode on the final post regardless of circumstances even if no external force is applied.  If the forcewave has already been released breaking the host object will no longer counter/deactivate the enchantment. Can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle.
<br><br><b>Upgrade to Sock 'Em</b><br>
This enchantment enhances the object's impact force (provided the object is no larger than a baseballl in size) for two full rotations before going on a one post cool down. While not actively increasing the actual weight of the item in question, the enchantment increases its impact force and causes the item to charge up whenever flying through the air. The furthest possible distance an object can travel (in order for this enchantment to remain active and effective, not that the object itself will suddenly stop moving since it’s nonmagic) is 15 feet (scaling to 20 feet at Expert Mage). If the maximum distance of 15 feet is achieved the objects impacting force is strong enough to feel like it’s slugging with added weight of up to 30 (40 at Expert Mage) pounds. 30 pounds is if the object travels as a projectile for a full 15 feet, every foot it travels stacking a 2 extra pounds and this does not provide a piercing power as it has no destructive measurement, it simply increases the impacting force behind the base object. 
If bonus mana is woven into this object with the enchantment on it for one post then it will be covered in a sheen of mana that bursts on contact, releasing a 1 foot circular blast of kinetic energy that (instead of rending objects hit) will knock them back several feet if weighing no more than 100 pounds. Maximum knockback distance from the contact burst is 10 feet, this lessens by 1 foot for every 10 pounds closer to the 100 mark (so for example, something weighing 100 lbs is knocked back 1 foot, whereas if it was 10 lbs or less it’d be 10 feet, same application of math for anything between 10 and 100). If a direct hit from this blasty projectile lands on an average human (150~200 lbs) then it’ll stagger them, anyone 100 lbs or less just defaults to the previous ratio. Can only push objects/entities that aren’t otherwise being held down or secured in place with spells and/or restraints. Only able to be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle.
<br><br><b>Upgrade to No Thanks~</b><br>
When used on an small handheld object, this enchantment will become covered in a thick layer of the caster’s own nonsolid mana for three maximum posts. Without help of extra mana, the object will do seemingly nothing at all, but if the Enchanter weaves half of the amount of mana it took to cast the enchantment in the first place, the mana coating will suddenly be able to be manipulated into a one-time use only rounded pane of solid mana equal to Iron (scaling to Cobalt at Expert Mage) in strength so long as it is directly in contact with the item and can be formed anywhere along its structure. This barrier is six feet in diameter and is capable of defending against a singular attack of equal ranking before breaking, primarily physical attacks. After the secondary effect is used, the barrier may remain for two posts (unless destroyed) before both the barrier and the enchantment itself completely deactivate regardless if it hasn't hit the three-post limit. The front surface of the shield may now be manipulated into small three-inch spikes of equal strength to the spell itself. The formation of spikes is possible in both stages (when it’s passively coating the object, and when it’s in shield mode). When in shield mode, making the spikes allows them to be as durable as the spell’s rank and have the same piercing power, but the shield’s durability drops by 1 rank. Can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle.
<br><br><b>Tropical Pop</b><br>
This enchantment causes the next time the object strikes a solid surface to radiate colorful energy. This energy collects as large basketball sized bubbles which are extremely sensitive to touch and will pop upon contact with any solid object. When popped they release a localized blast of hot energy one foot in diameter that can cause painful blisters and heat rashes on sentient/biological materials while simultaneously melting through inanimate objects and/or constructs of iron durability or less. These bubbles float around in a ten foot radius around the impact point, not responding to the caster’s body to keep them safe and does not save them from friendly fire if something else touches a bubble when they are nearby. This zone and its bubbles will remain until three posts have passed which will cause all current bubbles (at a maximum of three at a time within the zone) to disappear instantly. The object that’s the source of this enchantment can travel up to 10 feet away from the zone, but it’ll immediately deactivate if it ever gets any further than that. Additionally, if the object gets further than 10 feet from the CASTER the spell will also deactivate. Can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle.
<br><br><b>Rainbow!</b><br>
When activated, this enchantment causes the object used to shoot out a beam of light energy (not to be confused with basic photomancy light or Hardlight, simply being flavor text for an energy that produces light) conveying the perfect rainbow sequence across its surface. This “Light” can be used to illuminate nonmagic darkness for up to 10 feet around itself, dropping to 5 feet for magic darkness and won’t do anything to magic darkness higher ranking than itself. The rainbow itself shoots out at a human running speed, cylindrical in shape and is 1 foot in diameter and 5 feet in length but travels a maximum distance of 20 feet (costs additional mana to extend and/or shorten its length between 5 and 20 feet). It goes in a straight line, causing 2nd degree burns on sentient/biological material, but anything inanimate whether it be object or construct it’ll melt through easily assuming the durability is Iron or less (scaling to Cobalt upon reaching Expert). Rainbow! lasts for three rotations and can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free”. These objects can’t measure more than 5 feet at any angle.
<br><h1>Expert Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Upgrade to Big Boom!: Kapow Punch</b><br>
The caster enchants an item to become coated in a thick six-inch layer of easily broken cushion-like mana around one intended part, able to now be cast immediately with a second or so being required between each use of the spell. The object in question remains otherwise unaffected, but upon harsh physical contact with another surface--or at the caster’s discretion--the cushion will break open and release the mana it held in a forward blast of kinetic energy. The blast extends forward in a 10x10 foot wide wave that is 5x5 feet from top to bottom with a maximum range of 20 feet and causes a very visible distortion in its path. This aspect scales naturally to High Mage, becoming 15x15 wide, 10x10 tall with a range of 30 feet. It moves at a fast pace (x3) and can completely destroy constructs of Cobalt (scaling to very fast (x4) with Titanium damage) as well as pick up objects about twice as heavy as the average human (about 300 - 350 lbs~) and pick them up. The items picked up will find themselves trapped in the entire path unless they have a restraint/spell keeping them in place greater than the wave’s power for damage. Anything less and the wave would break through and continue pushing. Kapow Punch lasts for 2 rotations and is single-use only, meaning that once fully activated it needs to be re-cast before being able to be used again. On the last post the enchantment will activate regardless of external circumstances. 
<br>This enchantment can now be used as a means of mobility, and with the correct intention the burst of kinetic energy will be reduced to a 1x1 foot blast with a range of 5 feet, dealing its normal damage only on the point of direct contact, reduced to one rank lower for anything more. The blast will instead send the Enchanter/Enchantress speeding away in the opposite direction that the blast is pointed, though any sudden direction changes (I.E. from going forward to backward without a stop) can cause varying forms of damage to their body. The range on this is equal to the normal range of the blast, and sends them flying at x3 speed - scaling to x4 at High Mage (with a total upper cap of x8). Can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle. Casting Kapow Punch on an object requires recent physical contact with the caster, they don’t have to be touching it at the time of casting, but they do have to be aware of the object’s presence and it can’t have been long since they last made contact. Also can’t be too far away. (Within 3 rotations of time and 20 feet of distance). 
<br><br><b>Upgrade to Rainbow!: Rainbow Blade</b><br>
When activated, this enchantment causes the object to shoot out a beam of light energy (not to be confused with basic photomancy light or Hardlight, simply being flavor text for an energy that produces light) conveying the perfect rainbow sequence across its surface. This “Light” can be used to illuminate nonmagic darkness for up to 10 feet around itself, dropping to 5 feet for magic darkness and won’t do anything to magic darkness higher ranking than itself. The Rainbow itself shoots out at a fast speed (about x3), cylindrical in shape and is 1 foot in diameter and 5 feet in length with a maximum travel distance of 30 feet (costs additional mana to extend and/or shorten its length between 5 and 30 feet). Its speed and distance increase to x4 and 35 feet at High Mage. It goes in a straight line, causing harsh 3rd degree burns on sentient/biological material, but anything inanimate will be melted through easily assuming the durability is Cobalt or less, scaling naturally to Titanium. Extra mana can also be used to increase the diameter of the Rainbow from anywhere between 1 - 10 feet, costing increasingly more mana the larger it is. The enchantment lasts for three rotations when activated normally and can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free”. These objects can’t measure more than 5 feet at any angle. 
<br>Alternatively, the rainbow can be contained to a 5 foot long beam, similar in display of a normal sword with the same cutting/slicing power as before. The blade can remain on whatever object it was created on, but if it’s created on a glove or otherwise in the hand area, it can be “held” though it’s not actually solid. When wielded in this way, the enchantment no longer has a maximum duration and lasts as long as the caster is willing/has the mana to support its existence. Atany time they can expel a chunk of mana while it’s in sword form to release it as its normal attack, which then ends the spell automatically. Casting Rainbow Blade on an object requires recent physical contact with the caster, they don’t have to be touching it at the time of casting, but they do have to be aware of the object’s presence and it can’t have been long since they last made contact. Also can’t be too far away. (Within 3 rotations of time and 20 feet of distance). 
<br><br><b>Upgrade to No Thanks~: Safeguard</b><br>
When used on a small handheld object, this enchantment will cause a thick, one-time use only rounded pane of solid mana equal to Cobalt, scaling to Titanium, in strength so long as it is directly in contact with the item though it can be formed anywhere along its structure. This barrier is 10 feet in diameter and is capable of defending against a singular attack of equal ranking before breaking, primarily physical attacks. After the shield is summoned it may remain for 3 rotations, increasing to 4 at High Mage, unless destroyed before both the barrier and the enchantment itself completely deactivate. The outer surface of the barrier may be manipulated into six-inch spikes equal in strength to the shield itself. Making the spikes causes the shield’s durability to drop by 1 rank, but they still have at-rank piercing abilities. 
<br>If the Enchanter wishes, the defensive pane--which must be determined at the time of casting the spell--can wrap around the object’s entirety and everything directly connected to it so long as it doesn’t measure more than what is available in the pane form at any point. This “skin suit” will retain all of the abilities of the normal shield (I.E. being able to summon spikes along its surface, though the caster has to decide whether or not to keep the speed buff or to make the spikes as they can’t exist at the same time), but when used in this way the wearer will receive a boost to their physical speed equal to x2 with a cap of x8 (scaling to x4 speed at High Mage). The boon will last only as long as the enchantment is active, and it requires one rotation before it can be used again if this part of the enchant is utilized. The spell as a whole can only be cast on nonsentient/nonbiological/nonmagical objects readily available to the caster for “free,” and they can’t measure more than five feet at any angle. Casting Safeguard on an object requires recent physical contact with the caster, they don’t have to be touching it at the time of casting, but they do have to be aware of the object’s presence and it can’t have been long since they last made contact. Also can’t be too far away. (Within 3 rotations of time and 20 feet of distance).
